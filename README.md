# PAFcode
Sifting and plotting single pulse candidates with a random assortment of scripts for PAF post-processing.

## Plotting and sifting

`candwrapper2020.py` is the main thing here. Running it requires only the source name, the PAF search and results directories are set as defaults so you don't have to touch those options. So running it is simply
```sh
python candwrapper.py --source <source name>
```
The wrapper... yes the wrapper... finish later...
